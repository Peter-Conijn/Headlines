# Introduction

This is a short demo for a very simple event based implementation of the headline functionality.

## Brief overview

An event handler has been placed on the sales header OnInsert. This event will enter a record into a headline table. The Headline page based on that table will display the three latest headlines.
Use the Red Rabbit profile as your default in Business Central to open the web client on that role center. Then, add a few sales documents, refresh the page, and see what happens.
